# dsh-agent-team Documentation

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

This directory contains the maintained engineering documentation for this repository. The root `AGENTS.md` keeps only rules that every task must know; [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) here routes doc edits and maintenance — read it before changing anything under `docs/`. Use this index for detailed workflows, architecture, domain language, and cross-repository navigation.

## Documentation rules

Editing or adding a document under `docs/`? Routing branches and the maintenance discipline live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — read it first.

## Where to start

- **Host or domain changes:** [`architecture/README.md`](architecture/README.md) for boundaries, [`domain-model.md`](domain-model.md) for vocabulary; `packages/agent-team/src/` and its tests are the authority. Use `.scratch/README.md` to locate historical decisions when needed.
- **Tools, preset, or `/team` changes:** the relevant sections of [`architecture/README.md`](architecture/README.md), then the Harness cookbook and subsystem docs.
- **Client or UI changes:** [`frontend-design/README.md`](frontend-design/README.md) for the UI system, [`harness-navigation.md`](harness-navigation.md) for the cross-repository route.
- **Installation, build, tests, or Remote generation:** [`development/README.md`](development/README.md), then the actual `package.json` or script implementation.
- **Publishing a release:** [`release-runbook.md`](release-runbook.md) for the procedure and its gates, then [`dsh-release-compatibility.md`](dsh-release-compatibility.md) for the certification that must precede any peer-range change.
