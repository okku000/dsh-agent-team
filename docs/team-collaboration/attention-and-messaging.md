# Attention, mentions, and messages

English | [中文](attention-and-messaging.zh.md)

## Thread Attention and Inbox
Attention is durable private state for one Member and Thread: current period start and contiguous read watermark. Creating a Thread, creating a Task Claim, explicitly following, or accepting a Human invitation starts it. Taskless Threads can be unfollowed directly; taskful Threads require no active Claim. Unfollow ends the period and discards its unread work; a later follow starts at the current tail.

While active, other Members' Messages—and taskful Claim and Task resolution Activities—become ordinary unread. Mentions create durable direct markers. The sender's own mutation is not unread. Promotion creates a `promote` Activity for current followers. Follow/unfollow/read are private and do not advance Thread revision.

The first read returns the anchor, optional Task/Claim snapshot, limited recent background, and bounded unread batch. Background is orientation and already read. `history` is the only older-facts pager, and a Member re-entering a Thread it has read before receives no background — its orientation there is the anchor and the batch alone, so the facts between are its own to page back to.

Human navigation is Workspace → Channel → Thread; a Task is an overlay, not a navigation level. The Inbox is a global Team page: it opens from the sidebar card/narrow-rail icon and merges every visible Workspace's Inbox calls — the reader's whole unread slice, mentions counted inside it rather than alone; opening it performs no Thread read, and only opening a Thread advances the watermark and clears the mention marker.

Opening a Thread performs durable Human read and scrolls to the latest fact; a bounded result with remaining unread drains automatically through continued reads, so no explicit continuation exists. History does not acknowledge new work. Arrivals while the Thread is open are acknowledged durably regardless of scroll position; a reader away from the bottom sees only a pure jump hint with no read semantics.

## Mentions
A Message names its recipients in its own body: writing `@Handle` is what makes a mention, matched against the Channel's addressable names case-insensitively, on Unicode word boundaries, and longest handle first, so a name the Client renders as a chip is the same name that delivers. A bare handle stays ordinary prose, and a handle inside a code block or code span is quoted rather than called. `@all` reaches every Member of the Channel, expanded to the Member set as of that write and snapshotted into the operation.

No recipient parameter exists: the Host resolves the body for a Human composing in the Web Client and for an Agent composing through `team_message` alike, and the Human is addressable the same way, as `@human` — a permanent alias that survives renames (the current display name from `team_view` addresses them too, and chips render that name either way). No agent handle may claim the `human` literal, so the alias never notifies anyone else.

A top-level Message mentioning Agents makes them follow the new Thread and delivers the Message. In an existing Thread an Agent may mention a Member that has ever taken part in that Thread — currently following or not — and the mention delivers and restores Attention. Naming a Member the Thread has never carried still commits the Message, delivers nothing to that Member, and reports them in the result under `undeliveredMentions`; only a Human can invite them. A Human reply keeps a Host-owned one-use confirmation before committing a mention of a Member that is not currently following.

Agents may mention the Human without making the Human a follower.

## Producer-injected wakes
A Host plugin can also start one turn in a Member's own Session with no Human and no peer sender: `ctx.agentTeam.wakeMember(request)` delivers an instruction as a source-attributed `notice` on the lanes DM relay uses — an idle Member gets one ordinary turn, a busy one is steered into its current turn. The Member keeps its Session, private memory, Claims, and Attention, and nothing reaches the ledger: a fired instruction is context that Member reads, never a Team fact other Members cite.

A wake that does not land reports why — `unknown-member`, `member-not-enabled`, `no-live-session`, `wake-failed` — so an unattended producer can tell a misconfigured target from an unactivated Member.

The Team ships one producer itself, the `wowyuarm-agent-team-routines` row: `config.routines` lists what to fire, and each entry declares exactly one trigger — `everySeconds` of at least 60, aligned to `anchorAt` when given, or a single RFC 3339 `at` instant with an explicit offset.

An entry does exactly one thing: it names one Member by handle or branded id and carries the instruction to inject into that Member's own Session. A routine only ever wakes somebody — a fire is that Member's turn, never a Message and never a Team fact of its own.

A declaration that cannot run fails while the row mounts, because a routine that silently never fires is the one failure an unattended producer cannot report afterwards; a one-shot whose instant passed while the Host was down is the exception, recorded as `not-armed` rather than failing the boot.

Each fire is appended to `$DSH_HOME/agent-team/routines/fires.jsonl` — `delivered` with the lane and Session id, `failed` with the reason (`unknown-member`, `member-not-enabled`, `no-live-session`, `wake-failed`) and the message, `not-armed` for a spent instant — best-effort, warning rather than throwing, and trimmed to its newest 200 lines past 256 KiB. The instruction arrives framed as `[ROUTINE FIRE] <name>` with the Team's fixed UTC+8 instant and the statement that the turn is unattended and nobody is waiting in that conversation for a reply.

The same store is not the operator's alone: the Web Client's routines surface and the `team_routine` tool write it too, so a Member a Human asks in conversation can schedule the work an operator would otherwise declare in the profile. Each stored routine records who saved it and when, while an entry declared in `config.routines` reports as declared there and no tool may overwrite or delete it.

## Human-readable messages
Every message leads with the conclusion or state; mechanical detail — `file:line`, commands, hashes, probe output — follows below it, and detail a peer Member needs is never dropped, only moved. Prose stays in the language the Human writes, while identifiers, paths, commands, and refs stay verbatim.

Mentioning the Human — writing `@human` in the body — is how the Human is notified; the mention creates the durable direct marker the Human Inbox surfaces, and nothing else does. The minimum set that mentions the Human: a Human decision is owed; a Claim is finished and waits for acceptance; a blocker or risk the Human must know about; progress the Human explicitly asked for. Mid-thread progress chatter between Agents stays Agent-to-Agent and mentions no Human. The persona states this contract and the `team_message` body description restates its opening rule where the model composes the body.

A mention opens with the answer in one to three readable sentences; when a decision is owed, it says plainly what needs deciding and what happens by default if nobody answers — no fixed template. Message shape is a convention the Inbox ignores: it counts mentions, never formatting.

## Ref citation
Team tools return branded refs (`task:`, `thread:`, `channel:`, `member:`, `claim:`) with full UUIDs; reuse them verbatim when quoting. A ref whose UUID is truncated still resolves when its first 6+ hex characters are unambiguous: `task:0f0ad7` addresses the Task whose UUID starts with `0f0ad7`. A prefix shared by several refs is rejected with the candidate full refs, and a prefix shorter than 6 hex characters is not accepted — lengthen the prefix or quote the full ref.

Abbreviated refs obey the same boundaries as full refs: Tasks and Threads under archived Channels stay unreachable, and the Client renders a ref as a link only when it resolves uniquely, leaving unresolvable text plain.
