# Mutation fences and boundaries

## Mutation fences
Existing-Thread public mutations require the current next-write token in `baseRevision` — an opaque copy-through value, not a fact about the Thread: the model copies the latest explicitly rendered value verbatim and never increments, derives, compares, or cites it. The token appears on exactly two surfaces: a `team_thread read` that leaves no unread remaining, and a committed public mutation (`team_message` start/reply, `team_claim` mutation) whose result returns the resulting Thread state.

It is absent from `team_view`, `team_inbox`, `team_thread status/follow/unfollow/history`, `team_claim list`, partial reads, and every typed rejection — a fresh-looking token there would invite a blind retry.

Host checks: (1) relevant unread must be read, otherwise `unread_required`; (2) the token must match the current Thread revision, otherwise `stale_revision`; (3) closed Tasks reject replies, Claims, and new Attention. Taskless Threads have no Claim or Task-resolution mutation. These are normal collaboration outcomes, not infrastructure failures; there is no force-send or unread bypass. A rejected mutation renders no token; recovery is always read the Thread and reconsider.

Human close releases active Claims and ends Attention. Reopen restores an open Task but not previous Attention periods.

## Human Remote boundary
The Human Client uses `readThread`, `threadHistory`, `threadObservations`, `changeAttention`, and `changes`, and it consumes the Host's Human Inbox slice as the 「收件箱 / Inbox」 queue: one Inbox call per visible Workspace — the whole unread slice, `directCount` per row and `totalUnreadCount` for the badge — merged across Workspaces into the badge and the Inbox page.

That page renders the Host's two slices: the unread queue 「需要我」, whose counts the badge and header totals describe, and the 「最近活跃」 tail of Threads the reader has written a Message in — a reply makes a Thread theirs whether or not they follow it, and so does a Thread they started that nobody has answered yet, because a reply does not implicitly follow and Attention therefore decides what notifies a reader rather than what they took part in — newest activity first, each Workspace's slice bounded to ten and the merged page showing at most five, never a Thread the queue already holds.

Neither slice names an archived Channel's Threads: archival ends participation as well as notification. An Agent's Inbox receives the queue alone. Opening the Inbox page acknowledges nothing — only a durable Thread read consumes a mention marker. `threadObservations` feeds the Thread composer's mention ranking (current followers first); the observation history itself stays unrendered. Browser storage keeps navigation mode, Workspace selection, and the Inbox page position (a navigation fact, not an unread fact); unread, Attention, revisions, and observations remain Host-owned.

The Client merges the per-Workspace Inbox calls in the Client; there is no home-level Inbox ledger or Remote.

## Team Member context boundary
The explicit `team-member` preset contains coding tools, background jobs, the skill loader tool, todo, compaction, all nine Team tools, Workspace instruction discovery, and private-memory context. Harness `agent-instructions` remains the sole loader for `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. Each Member private root has `memory.md`, `notes/`, and `skills/`; only a bounded 16 KiB escaped reference index is injected, and the block states its current usage as `X.X KiB / 16 KiB` with a percentage. Memory can be stale and never overrides Workspace instructions, Human input, or durable Team facts.

Do not store credentials, sensitive data, guesses, chat logs, or facts already owned by the ledger.

The persona states the private-space physical facts (the injected absolute paths, never cwd-relative ones, the memory/notes discipline, and the reusable-assets boundary), plus one concise paragraph of context-management guidance: keep the active context the smallest sufficient working set, record a checkpoint before a risky phase and return to it through `context_rollover` when a phase collapses, roll fresh through `context_rollover` when history stops paying for itself (persisting anything worth keeping to private memory/notes first), that a context change never rolls back external effects, and to bridge current state in the handoff.

All skill craft — what deserves to be a skill, directory-form layout, writing quality, credentials — lives in the bundled `member-skill-manager` meta skill, whose description routes skill-management work to itself; loading any skill stays the Member's own judgment per task.
